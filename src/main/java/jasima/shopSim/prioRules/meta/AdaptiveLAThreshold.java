/**
 * This class implements a rule with a max waiting time threshold value
 * specified relative to the minimum time it takes to process any job waiting in
 * the queue. maxWaitRelative has to be in the range [0,1]. The maximal useful
 * waiting time actually is even a little smaller than 1: if a job arrives in
 * say 10 time units, but to process the shortest job in queue also takes 10
 * time units, it could be finished exactly when the lookahead job arrives.
 * <p>
 * This class does not take setup times into account.
