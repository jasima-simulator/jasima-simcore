/**
 * This class implements a rule that sequences job in increasing order of their
 * job number. As this attribute strongly correlates to the time of arrival, the
 * rule operates similarly to {@link FASFS}. However, there are subtle
 * differences between the two implementations. With the FASFS rule, jobs can
 * have equal priorities if they arrived at exactly the same instant. Therefore,
 * this rule is preferred as a final tie-breaker as it ensures a deterministic
 * order.
